ECE4905 - OSU Capstone Class for Electrical and Computer Engineer

Summary - The project goal is to collect water (either from rain, river, any external souce through nature) pass it through a pH sensor powered by a Arduino and display on a TLC Touchscreen. All of this will be powered by a solar panel and charging a battery.

Info - The code is what I created for the display screen using C++ language. The screen is to display on power a pH number reading from the sensor and two buttons to redirect users to either a battery information and extra information.

pH Number - The number will display in green if the water is drinkable and red if the water is not drinkable.
Battery Screen - This page is to display if the batter is currently charging and how much capacity it is currently at.
Extra Screen - This is intended to be used to display a mini user manual for clients in the future but is currently used as a team summary.

Equipment:
- Arduino Board
- MSP 432
- TLC 3.2 Touch Screen
- pH Sensor
